# Individual Project #1: Rust CLI
Build a useful command-line tool in the domain of data engineering or machine learning engineering.

## Week 1 Progress

In this week, I learned some basics of Rust and the usage of Rust Project Template (from https://github.com/nogibjj/rust-new-project-template), and I gained some hands-on experience on building my first Rust project -- [n-queens problem](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-answers-chess-problem-about-attacking-queens-20210921/).

### Usage
> Run `cargo run -- n-queen -i [size]` to form all possible n-queens problem solutions with board size equals to `size`, where queens are represented by 'Q' and empty tiles are represented by '.'; e.g. the output of running command `cargo run -- n-queen -i 4` is

```
[
    [
        ".Q..",
        "...Q",
        "Q...",
        "..Q.",
    ],
    [
        "..Q.",
        "Q...",
        "...Q",
        ".Q..",
    ],
]
```
> where the two boards above shows the only two valid solutions to the n-queens (4-queens here) problem with board size of 4.

## Week 2 Progress

This week I learned some basics of cloud computing and had some hands-on experience with AWS and Azure. Unfortuately, due to personal illness that lasted from Friday to Tuesday, this week my progress is low--I only viewed the tutorial and tried deploying an AWS lambda function with my n-queens game developed last week, yet this does not work as expected. Hopefully this will be resolved in the upcoming week.
